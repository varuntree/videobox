# VoiceBox Kiosk Upgrade Summary

## âœ… Completed Refactor

The VoiceBox system has been completely refactored to eliminate desktop flashes and create a seamless kiosk experience.

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. **Bare X11 Kiosk Session**
- Created `config/.xinitrc` - Boots directly into X11 without LXDE desktop
- No desktop means no flashes between videos
- Includes cursor hiding and power management settings

#### 2. **Persistent MPV with IPC**
- Added `MPVController` class to `src/voicebox.py`
- Single MPV process runs continuously with socket-based control
- Videos switch via `loadfile` commands instead of process restarts
- Eliminates window destruction gaps that caused flashes

#### 3. **Enhanced Background Manager**
- Updated `src/background_manager.py` to stay topmost
- Added geometry fix to eliminate black corner strip
- Properly covers entire screen behind MPV window

#### 4. **New Kiosk Service**
- Created `config/voicebox-kiosk.service` systemd unit
- Replaces LXDE autostart mechanism
- Automatic restart on failure

#### 5. **Updated Deployment**
- Modified `scripts/setup_pi.sh` to:
  - Install required X11 packages (xserver-xorg, xinit, unclutter)
  - Disable LXDE and old autostart methods
  - Configure kiosk service automatically
  - Set up all configuration files

#### 6. **Cleanup**
- Removed obsolete files:
  - `scripts/hide_desktop.sh`
  - `config/voicebox.desktop`
- Removed window mode code (no longer needed)

## ðŸš€ Expected Results

After reboot, the system will:

1. **Boot directly into kiosk mode** - No LXDE desktop visible
2. **Zero desktop flashes** - MPV window never gets destroyed
3. **No black corner artifacts** - Background window properly sized
4. **Instant video transitions** - Videos switch via IPC commands
5. **Auto-recovery** - Service restarts if anything crashes

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Complete deployment** - The Pi is currently updating packages
2. **Add Picovoice key** - Edit `.env` file on Pi
3. **Reboot** - `sudo reboot` to activate kiosk mode
4. **Test voice commands** - "americano", "bumblebee", "grasshopper"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **MPV IPC Socket**: `/tmp/mpvsocket` for real-time control
- **Service**: `voicebox-kiosk.service` (replaces lightdm)
- **X Session**: `~/.xinitrc` (minimal X11 setup)
- **Background**: Persistent Tkinter window (stays behind MPV)

The system is now a true kiosk appliance with professional-grade seamless video playback!
